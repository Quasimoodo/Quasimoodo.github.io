今天读到了Philip Larkin(菲利普·拉金) 觉得他确实写出了一些人类的共有困境，是超越东西方的 也不好说是现代视角或者古典视角。用诗歌描述一种……symptom？没有意象的堆叠或者是故作惊人之语。恰到好处的建筑与音韵意识又不喧宾夺主，克制的情感流露并着个人色彩。 类似于散文诗？

现摘在这里这一首，「Love Songs in Age」
She kept her songs, they kept so little space,
The covers pleased her:
One bleached[^1] from lying in a sunny place,
One marked in circles by a vase of water,
One mended[^2], when a tidy fit had seized her,
And coloured, by her daughter -
So they had waited, till, in widowhood
She found them, looking for something else, and stood

Relearning how each frank submissive chord[^3]
Had ushered[^4] in
Word after sprawling hyphenated[^5] word,
And the unfailing sense of being young
Spread out like a spring-woken tree, wherein
That hidden freshness sung,
That certainty of time laid up in store
As when she played them first. But, even more,

The glare[^6] of that much-mentionned brilliance, love,
Broke out, to show
Its bright incipience[^7] sailing above,
Still promising to solve, and satisfy,
And set unchangeably in order. So
To pile them back, to cry,
Was hard, without lamely[^8] admitting how
It had not done so then, and could not now.
